# FinalProject

Eric, Bili, and Matt worked together for a week on a Pizza App. This app allows the user to navigate from the home page to 
an ordering page and select what pizza they want from a list of options, if they have registered and logged in. Once they have gotten through the paper work and ordered, they are able to have their history recorded and retrieved at will. This system also enables the business owner to look at everyone's history and calculate things such as gross sales and the most common toppings ordered. 

Functionality:

1. The frontend provides a UI for the user to enage with in such a way that they can easily 
navigate from the home page to the order page and create an order, even if they have never been to the site before.

2. The frontend includes a pizza combination animator that updates the user's particular requests, from dough and sauce to cheese and extra toppings. 

3. The backend gathers the user's input and stores it. This data can be retrieved by the user for
a personal history. Furthermore, the user's history can be combined with every other customer's, resulting in an overview of the latest business cycle. 

4. Security is in place prevening new users from making a purchase and restricting users to their own personal history. Only the admin can get a glimpse into everyone else's account.
